#Hardware
For this project I used the following hardware:
* Arduino Uno
* LiquidCrystal lcd-screen 16x2 (for Arduino)
* NFC-shield (for Arduino)
* Ethernet-shield (for Arduino)

#Software
For this project I used the following software:
* Atom editor (version 1.41.0)
* Arduino editor (V 1.8.10)
  * Arduino serialport-module
* MAMP local server (version 5.5)
* MySQL database

#Roadmap
The way to go forward with this project is to start using Johnny-five in combination with web-sockets to make a connection between the Arduino and the server to reach the database.
